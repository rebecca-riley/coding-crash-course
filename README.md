# coding-crash-course
This is a project in progress to help physics graduate students write better, more maintainable code.

Links to Google forms and responses spreadsheets:
Class schedule form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGU2JaX4v_Ui3Si2rVML3D-tYAMMBc_Bp9ijhQuXaUiGj0KQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
TA schedule form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdk8Qn6V1eKkiBVpObjAn1x0wuqqlcfmEBT-Q8kFsa6f8LSxA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Class response spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wi_8w3pYvck6fWx7N8r5dqy5dFvk69f9vp9HD8Eh_W0/edit#gid=2092920551
TA response spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tklgbRt9z19EefryLF3Eni4vLP2COPssanAvZ90-pDc/edit?usp=sharing

If you submit a response to the form, it will show up on the response spreadsheet.  To use the responses with the code, go to File > Download as > Tab-separated values, put the resulting file in the same folder as the python script, and rename it 'class_schedules.tsv' or 'TA_schedules.tsv'.

Unfortunately, due to technicalities of Google forms, I can't share the back end without giving public edit access.
